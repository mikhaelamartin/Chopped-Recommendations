# What Makes A TV Show Awesome?

# Searching for the Best Chopped Episodes to Rerun

## Business Objectives:
what do you want to do? Why do you want to do?

Chopped is one of my favorite television shows. Although I haven't watched every episode, somehow I have watched the same episode multiple times. But, not on purpose. Television shows have a tendency to rerun the same favorited episodes because they know what the people like to see.

Using this dataset which contains information about the first 567 episodes and this article about the top 10 Chopped episodes according to imDb, I want to understand which types of episodes the people crave for.

I will use clustering techniques to detect patterns and make recommendations on which episodes to rerun.
